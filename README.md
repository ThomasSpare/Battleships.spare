# How to play
---
![gameplay](https://github.com/ThomasSpare/Battleships.spare/blob/main/documentation/images/battleship_cover.png)

The user start the game by entering a username and choosing a board. At the moment only one board is available (5x5).
After this instructions follow telling the user how to win (I didn't win a single time when playing).

The storyline is that Captain Mcwhir who has gone mad and turned agianst us is hiding his fleet and the user must 
find his ships before the typhoon comes within 10 turns.
The user must hit 5 ships in the 10 turns given. The CPU place its ships randomly on the board. 


## Typhoon scenario
---
In the middle of designing the game I came up with the idea of using storms (typhoons) on the board while 
the game went on. The storms would travel from the top of the board down to the bottom. If a ship that already 
had a hit, either the COMP or users ship, was caught up in one of these storms the ship that was partly 
visible would disapear in the storm and be hidden again and moved to a different location. 

So the players would have to shoot the ship down before a typhoon came over it. If the hidden ship then would
recieve another hit the ship parts that was previously struck would be displayed again.

# Flowchart

## The flow chart above was my original idea for the game. The leaderboard function is not active in the game.



## After constructing the game the flowchart looked more like this:

# Debugging

## Manual Testing

I tried entering every possible combination in the input fields and found that the game crashed
most often in the row / column input selection. So I used boolean operators in this part of the code to
nail down all the valid input values such as:
- To stop an integer input for a Column: type(yclm) != int:
- To stop a letter input (str) in a Row: type(xrow) == int:
---

**<li>Repeteadly Entering 'int' in row and 'int' in column<li>**
**This caused the game to crash in a while loop.**<br>

![int bug2](https://github.com/ThomasSpare/Battleships.spare/blob/main/documentation/Bugs/int2_bug.jpg)<br>
**Solution:**<br>
After some manual debugging I found a solution with a while loop that 
almost made it impossible to crash the game.

## Avoiding a scrolling gameboard
From the start the gameboard would after each move scroll down and create a new
gameboard. I found this rather annoying so to prevent this from happening I
made use of the function clear.console() after each user input, placing the
gameboard in a more fixed position.

## The Typhoon scenario
The typhoon scenario is not operational as was intended. The code is there for it to work
but when trying to engage it after the typhoon turn drops to 0 the game would break.
My guess is it has to do with using the class Battleship in the run_game function.
The code should print a whole line filled on the user board and all hit enemy ships in 
this line would respawn and be placed in a new hidden location. 

# Testing
----
## PEP8

Code was checked during development using CI python Linter PEP8 with no errors
except line too long (81 > 79 characters) errors.
Some code parts would not work if shortend so I had to exceed the 80 line
mark on some parts.

## Manual testing

I have performed manual testing during the development cycle.
For instance user_name input accepts all inputs except an empty input but I found that 
repeatedly hitting enter bypasses this and the user is allowed to have a blank name. 


# Techologies and resources used
---

- Github
- Gitpod
- Heroku
- Python
- PEP8 Validator

# Python Libraries used in the game

- time (I used to display messages to the user that otherwise would just flicker by)
- random (is used to place enemy ships randomly on the board)
- termcolor (is used to declare hit or miss, win or lose messages)



# Future improvements
---
As the game is at present, rather rudimentary in featues, many
improvements could be built on this blueprint. 

For instance
- User can choose boardsize
- One user board / One CPU board
- Computer guess
- Advanced Computer guess
- Typhoon scenario  (se above image)
- Different ship sizes
